          <h2 id="story-title">From a truck bed to a hollow of our own</h2>
          <p>Mae Lindqvist and Tomás Rivera met pulling weeds on someone else's farm. In 2011 a retired dairyman named Walt let them work one acre of his worst ground for the price of a weekly bag of vegetables. The soil was thin, the hill was steep, and the rocks came up faster than the carrots.</p>
          <p>They sold that first summer from the tailgate at the Viroqua market. Two years later, 24 neighbors paid up front for a season of crates, and the CSA was born out of a borrowed walk-in cooler and a very long spreadsheet.</p>
          <p>In 2017 the hollow down the road came up for sale: 22 acres of south-facing slope, a spring-fed creek, and a barn with half a roof. We bought it with a farm loan and a lot of member prepayments, and every crate since has come out of that ground.</p>

          <p>We plant for the people who paid in February. That is the whole business plan, and it has held for fifteen years.</p>
