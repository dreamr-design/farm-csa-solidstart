Bramblecut Farm, a fictional five-person certified organic vegetable farm on 22 acres of Driftless hillside near Viroqua, Wisconsin. It sells a twenty-week CSA (the Stand Card, Half, Full and Kitchen shares, with pay-in-4 and sliding-scale options), runs an honor-box farm stand, and hosts four farm dinners a year at one long table in the squash field. The whole site is dressed as seed packets and produce crates, printed in two inks on kraft.

## Quick start

Install the dependencies, then start a preview at http://localhost:3000, which shows an edit when you reload the page:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Write the finished static site to `.output/public/`:

```
npm run build
```

The site title, description and every service setting live in `src/site.config.js`. Pages are `src/routes/<route>.jsx`; the shared header and footer are `src/app.jsx`, and the document head is `src/entry-server.jsx`; styles, scripts and images sit in `public/assets/`. Every page prerenders to plain HTML that loads no Solid code in the browser, and links are plain `<a>` tags, so every page load runs `public/assets/js/main.js`. Blog posts are `posts/*.html`, each opening with a front matter block; `src/lib/posts.js` reads them newest first, `src/routes/blog/index.jsx` and `src/routes/blog/page/[number].jsx` list them 6 at a time through `src/components/PostList.jsx`, and `src/routes/blog/[slug].jsx` shows one.

To deploy, connect the repo to Netlify: the included `netlify.toml` runs that same build and publishes `.output/public`. Any static host works the same way.

## Settings

- `chatsy_agent_id`: Chatsy agent id. Create a free AI chat agent at https://chatsy.ai, paste its id here, and a chat button appears on every page. Leave empty for no chat button.
- `slapform_form_id`: Slapform form id. Create a free form at https://slapform.com and paste its id here; every form on the site then delivers to your inbox with spam protection.

## Built-in services

### AI chat with Chatsy

Set `chatsy_agent_id` and a chat button in the theme's accent color appears on every page. Create an agent free at [chatsy.ai](https://chatsy.ai): it answers visitors from your own knowledge base.

### Working forms with Slapform

Set `slapform_form_id` and every form on the site (index, pricing, contact) delivers to your inbox. Create a form free at [slapform.com](https://slapform.com); no server needed. A form's `data-slapform-success` attribute sets its thank-you text.

## Design DNA

[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) describes the palette, type, spacing and signature moves so a designer or an AI assistant can extend the site in the same voice.

## Fonts

Google Fonts: Alfa Slab One, Courier Prime, Libre Franklin, Stardos Stencil.

## License

The `free` license: use it on any site and keep the footer credit. See `LICENSE.md`.
